Task 1: Understanding Branches

--> What is a branch in Git?
branch is like a sperate like of development.
it lets you make changes with touching the main/master branch

--> Why do we use branches instead of committing everything to main?
we use braches so that if multiple user are working on the same code and they push the changes it can break the production
and it will be full of mess hence we use branches

--> What is HEAD in Git?
HEAD points to your current branch

--> What happens to your files when you switch branches?
when we switch the branches it shows file of your branch which were commited.

eg : if main branch have hello.txt --> print "hello"
and bracnh have hellow.txt --> pint "hellow world" and you swithc from main to local branch it will show hellow.txt --> pint "hellow world"
