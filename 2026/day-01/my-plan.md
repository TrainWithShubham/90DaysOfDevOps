- **Why I am learning DevOps:**
  - So heres why I choose DevOps as the skill path the reason is when I got my first internship as web developer in 2023 I got interacted with the IT culturethen it won't take me so long to identify the most interesting and dependable jod in        the whole office which is DevOps but life has its own way to treat your ambition and then as I was familier with IT culture I gave interview for a QA role and get selected I work one whole year at this position and by doing this job it          brings me more closerto DevOps practices, then in 2025 August I started watching TWS one shot videos and finally when I have have a budget I immediately brought this amazing course.
  - the simple reason why I choose DevOps as career path is, it was the only thing which excite me the most at very first time (and I am a huge beliver in love at first sight). I want to be the engineer who keeps system running, scalable, and       sane.

    - Travel around the world by achiving the peak on remote role.
    - Get settle in Singapore/Europe/Japan with my family and give a high level education to my lil bro and excelent environment to my Mom & Dad.

- **Time Comitment and consistency plan:**
  - Week Days: 1.5 - 2 hours.
  - Weekends: 5 - 6 hours.
  - Total: 16 - 18 hours a week.
- **How I will stay consistent:**
  - By maintaining the discipline rather than just being motivated.
  - Be patient while learning.
  - And as I said DevOps makes me excited I will never get bored.
  - Focus hands-on practice, not just watch videos.
