Day-01 Assignment (Introduction)
Understanding of DevOps: What, Why, and How
What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture and mindset that focuses on collaboration and communication between the Development and Operations teams. The term DevOps was introduced by Patrick Debois, who observed that better coordination between these teams led to faster and more reliable software delivery. DevOps is not a single tool or just automation, and it is not merely a job title. At its core, DevOps aims to deliver software quickly, safely, and continuously.

Why DevOps?

Before DevOps, organizations faced several challenges such as long release cycles, frequent production failures, manual processes, and a lack of collaboration between teams, often resulting in blame games. The introduction of DevOps brought a major shift by enabling automation, improving collaboration, promoting smaller and more frequent releases, detecting issues early, and building reliable and scalable systems.

Business benefits of DevOps include:

Faster time to market

Improved customer satisfaction

Reduced downtime

Reduced operational stress for teams

How DevOps Works?

DevOps follows a continuous lifecycle, which is also represented in its logo. This lifecycle includes stages such as planning, coding, building, testing, deploying, and monitoring. These stages form a continuous loop aimed at constant improvement. Various tools are used at each stage of the lifecycle, with CI/CD pipelines forming the core and backbone of DevOps practices.

Summary

DevOps is a set of practices that bridges development and operations by automating software build, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes. The primary goal of DevOps is to enable faster delivery, improved reliability, and better collaboration between teams. Through this batch, I aim to gain hands-on experience with DevOps tools and workflows used in real-world production environments.

My Study Plan for This Journey

I want to learn DevOps to strengthen my understanding of modern software delivery systems and cloud-based infrastructure. During this journey, I will work with AWS and UTHO cloud servers. With the increasing demand for automation and scalable deployments, DevOps skills will help me build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently. My learning approach will be hands-on, focusing on practical labs, real-time projects, and troubleshooting issues during implementation. I also plan to practice regularly, document my learnings, and work on small projects alongside the batch curriculum.

Expected Outcome

By the end of this batch, my goal is to gain confidence in DevOps workflows and become capable of deploying and managing applications using modern DevOps tools and cloud platforms. I aim to secure a DevOps role in a mid-scale startup to gain practical exposure and real industry experience.
