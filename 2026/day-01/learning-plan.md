This is my Day-01 to kickstart my Devops journey

I am starting a 90DaysOfDevOpsChallenge conducted by @Shubham Londhe #TrainWithShubham

There are few tasks which i want to complete as day-01 tasks


1. What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
Answer: I am BCS 3rd year student and Devops fresher. A term DevOps is combination of devlopment+operations. DevOps focuses on automation,monitoring by build, test and deploy code through CI/CD pipeline and make the code fully automated using terraform. DevOps is such a great field if you love doing automate things, if you don't want to use logic in your code , if you are able to solve errors by seeing logs of your code then absoluetly devops is must have skill.



2. Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
Answer: I am learning DevOps and Cloud because I truly enjoy automating things and seeing my work run in real systems. Ilike fixing issues by checking logs, understanding how applications work in production, and making deployments faster and smoother. DevOps excites me because it is practical, hands-on, and lets me build and manage real-world infrastructure.
I want to build strong skills in Linux troubleshooting, CI/CD automation, and managing cloud infrastructure using tools like Docker and Terraform.



3. Where do you want to reach?
Answer: In the next 90 days, I want to build strong hands-on DevOps skills by working on real projects and understandinghow production systems work. My goal is to confidently deploy and manage applications using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, andbasic Kubernetes on the cloud. I also want to be job-ready for entry-level DevOps or Cloud roles by the end of this learning journey.



4. How you will stay consistent every single day?
Answer: I will follow a fixed daily study schedule and spend at least 4 hours on weekdays by focusing on hands-on and 5-6 hours on weekends by doing live lecture and practicing after lecture and will track my daily progress to stay consistent. Even on busy or low-energy days, I will ensure I do something small so that the learning period never breaks.
