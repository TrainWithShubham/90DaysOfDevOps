- I am on career break where I want to be a pro-level DevOps engineer. Earlier I had worked for companies as a Solution Engineer (worked on Linux/Ansible for deloyments of NOKIA company)with attleast 4 years of experience.
- 1.As mentioned above want  to be a pro-level DevOps engineer.
- 2.Ofcourse good job with good salary.
- 3.Want to know everything about DevOps to be able to provide solutions on all types of DevOps related problems.
- Skills -> CI/CD pieplines, k8s, docker, Terraform
- Weekdays 3-4hours. Weekends 2-2.5hrs



- As todays world actually revolves around DevOps & cloud platforms only so I have to be up-to-date in terms of IT industry.
- Not a professional in Developer side as coding is not my thing. But I've more interest in linux side platforms & very excited to get my hands done on DevOps side.
- Want to reach to a level where only I should be the 1 who can able to solve DevOps related problems.
- Atleast for an hour or 1.5hrs I will try to get some knowledge of DevOps/k8s/docker/Terraform.



Note : Due to some personal reasons sometimes I won't be able to join live sessions. But would request you to join me in your mock interviews.
