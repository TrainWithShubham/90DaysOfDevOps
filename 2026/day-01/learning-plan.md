#My Learning Plan for 90 days
My name is Shivkumar Konnuri, I am from QA+Support background | Learnig DevOps and Cloud for next 90 days

What i understand about DevOps
DevOps is a combination of Development & Operations, this means that development, operations and security team work together to build, deploy and maintain applications in a automated manner to reduce time for market.
Cloud Engineering means using cloud to build, deploy and maintain applications without managing physical servers and somme of the Cloud platforms are AWS, GCP and MS Azure.
A DevOps Engineer connects development, operations, and security teams to automate, deploy, monitor, and fix issues.

Why I am learning DevOps and Cloud 
I want here to be straight forward and dont want to beat around the bush. I want to learn devops for higher package, money, this doesnt means that i will do it for money sake only, i will learn the DevOps and Cloud engineering with my whole heart with full interest and also want to become an expert in DevOps and Cloud Engineering. If i become expert then only i can acheive my priority goal

Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days (My Goals)
By the end of the 90 days i want a job in DevOps and Cloud Engineering field with a decent package.

Rules I will follow to stay consistent:
I will complete each and every assignment given by Shubham bhai and also practice extra for consistency, and i will share my daily learnings on my GitHub and LinkedIn

My Mindset and Execution
Currently my mindset is to just learn as i am very new to this DevOps world even if i have worked with linux, AIX and windows environment i will still learn them again and analyse what new things i will get to learn.
I will treat this as a job and Shubham bhai as my manager for the next 90 days so that I can master it by the end of 90 days

Commitment Statement:
I am serious about pivotimg my role into DevOps. These 90 days are very very important for my future, my future will be decided on these 90 days, so i cant ignore this as its high time today i am 36 years old and earning very low.
