## Task
Today’s goal is to **set the foundation for your DevOps journey**.

    • What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
      -I am working with 2.5 years of AWS Cloud and DevOps experience. Currently, -I work on AWS Cloud using Windows servers, mainly with services such as EC2, CloudWatch, SNS, and S3, along with handling security and compliance-related issues.
      -I also work with DevOps tools to deploy a .NET-based Claims application using Artifactory, Jenkins, Terraform, Puppet, Packer, and Azure DevOps, and monitoring tools such as Apptio and CloudWatch.
      -Based on my experience, I have basic knowledge of a few AWS resources, mainly EC2, and beginner-level knowledge of DevOps tools like Terraform, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps. This means I can understand existing setups by learning and make small code or configuration changes, but I want to improve my depth of knowledge.

    • Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
      Currently, I have knowledge of only a few AWS services and DevOps tools, which is not sufficient to independently resolve all tasks that come in front of me.
      I want to gain deep technical knowledge and confidence so that I can resolve issues on my own without depending on others, as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer.
      Another important goal is to switch from my current organization. I have completed 4 years in the same company, but I feel stuck due to a lack of in-depth knowledge. Through this learning journey, I want to overcome both of these challenges.
    
    • Where do you want to reach? 
      -I want to be capable of solving my day-to-day DevOps and cloud tasks independently with proper understanding, instead of depending on others.
      -My goal is to work efficiently by focusing on cost optimization, automation, reliability, and reducing manual or lengthy work through better use of DevOps and cloud practices.
      -I also want to join a new organization with strong technical knowledge, where I can confidently fit into a DevOps role and handle responsibilities without difficulty.
       
         
    • How you will stay consistent every single day?
      -On working days (Monday to Friday), I will dedicate 2 hours daily to learning and hands-on practice.
      -On Saturday and Sunday, I will attend lectures and complete the tasks provided by Shubham Bhaiya. I will follow this plan consistently throughout the 90 days.
      -Additionally, I will post regularly on LinkedIn about what I have learned and understood. I will also participate in group studies on Discord to discuss issues and improve my understanding.

    • Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build-
    1. Linux & AWS Command-Level Expertise
       Gain strong command over Linux and AWS to manage systems, analyze logs, handle performance and security issues independently.
    2. End-to-End CI/CD Design & Automation
       Design, build, deploy, and automate CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Azure DevOps, not just debug existing ones.
    3. Kubernetes & Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
       Deploy, manage, and troubleshoot containerized applications on Kubernetes, and provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform with a focus on automation and reliability.
