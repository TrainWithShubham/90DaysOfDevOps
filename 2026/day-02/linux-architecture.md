HARDWARE: physical parts of a computer, such as central processing unit (CPU), monitor,
mouse, keyboard, hard disk and other connected devices to CPU.
KERNEL: A kernel is a computer program and is the central, core part of an operating system.
It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware, most notably memory and
CPU time. It is an integral part of any operating system.
SHELL: Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs,
and shell scripts. It is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. (User
interface program execution, file system manipulation, input/output operations, communication, resource
allocation, error detection, security and protection



1. Kernel:- The kernel is one of the core section of an operating system. It is
responsible for each of the major actions of the Linux OS. This operating system
contains distinct types of modules and cooperates with underlying hardware directly.
The kernel facilitates required abstraction for hiding details of low-level hardware or
application programs to the system. There are some of the important kernel types
which are mentioned below:
o Monolithic Kernel
o Micro kernels
o Exo kernels
o Hybrid kernels

2. System Libraries:- These libraries can be specified as some special functions. These
are applied for implementing the operating system's functionality and don't need code
access rights of the modules of kernel.
3. System Utility Programs:- It is responsible for doing specialized level and
individual activities.
4. Hardware layer:- Linux operating system contains a hardware layer that consists of
several peripheral devices like CPU, HDD, and RAM.
5. Shell:- It is an interface among the kernel and user. It can afford the services of
kernel. It can take commands through the user and runs the functions of the kernel.
The shell is available in distinct types of OSes. These operating systems are categorized
into two different types, which are the graphical shells and command-line shells.
The graphical line shells facilitate the graphical user interface, while the command line
shells facilitate the command line interface. Thus, both of these shells implement
operations. However, the graphical user interface shells work slower as compared to
the command-line interface shells.
There are a few types of these shells which are categorized as follows:
o Korn shell
o Bourne shell
o C shell
o POSIX shell

Linux Distribution
It is an OS that is composed of a software-based collection on Linux kernel or we can
say the distribution includes the Linux Kernel. It is supporting software and libraries.
We can obtain Linux-based OS by downloading any Linux distribution. These types of
distributions exists for distinct types of devices such as personal computers,
embedded devices, etc. Around more than 600 Linux distributions are existed and a
few of the famous Linux distributions are listed as follows:
o Deepin
o OpenSUSE
o Fedora
o Solus
o Debian
o Ubuntu
o Elementary
o Linux Mint
o Manjaro
o MX Linux



User mode vs Kernel mode
The code of kernel component runs in a unique privilege mood known as kernel
mode along with complete access to every computer resource. This code illustrates an
individual process, runs in an individual address space, and don't need the context
switch. Hence, it is very fast and efficient.
Kernel executes all the processes and facilitates various services of a system to the
processes. Also, it facilitates secured access to processes to hardware.
The support code that is not needed to execute in kernel mode is inside the system
library. The user programs and other types of system programs are implemented in
the user mode.
It includes no access to kernel mode and system hardware. User utilities/programs use
the system libraries for accessing kernel functions to obtain low-level tasks of the
system
