1} Mindset & Plan Review (Day 01)

My goal is still to become job-ready in DevOps within 90 days.

I will continue focusing on Linux fundamentals before moving deeply into cloud and CI/CD.

Improvement: Spend more time on hands-on instead of only reading notes.

2 Processes & Services Practice

Commands re-run today:

ps aux | head
systemctl status nginx
journalctl -u nginx --no-pager | tail -10
Observations:

ps aux shows all running processes with CPU and memory usage.

systemctl status nginx clearly shows whether service is active or failed.

journalctl helps debug service-related issues quickly.

3️⃣ File Skills Practice (Days 06–11)

Commands practiced:

echo "revision test" >> notes.txt
chmod 755 script.sh
chown tokyo:vault-team access-codes.txt
ls -l
mkdir test-folder

What I observed:

Permission changes immediately reflect in ls -l.

Wrong ownership can prevent access.

>> appends content without overwriting file.

4️⃣ My Incident Cheat Sheet (Top 5 Commands)

If production issue happens, I would use:

top
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
systemctl status <service>
journalctl -u <service>
ls -l

These help quickly:

Check CPU issues

Identify crashed services

View logs

Verify file permissions
