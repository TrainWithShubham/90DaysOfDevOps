# 🌍 Real-World Examples of OSI & TCP/IP Models

## OSI Model (7 Layers)
| Layer | Function | Real-World Example |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| Application | Provides services to user applications | HTTP, FTP, SSH |
| Presentation | Data formatting, encryption | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3 |
| Session | Manages sessions between hosts | NetBIOS, Remote Procedure Call |
| Transport | Ensures reliable data delivery | TCP (web traffic), UDP (video calls) |
| Network | Routes data between networks | IP, ICMP |
| Data Link | Node-to-node delivery | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |
| Physical | Transfers raw bits | Cables, Fiber, Radio Waves |

## TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
| Layer | Function | Real-World Example |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| Application | Defines communication protocols | HTTP, DNS, SMTP |
| Transport | Reliable/unreliable transport | TCP, UDP |
| Internet | Routing and addressing | IP, ICMP |
| Network Access | Hardware-level data transmission | Ethernet, ARP |
